## Note ##
To compile AFL++ from source in Android, you need clang-v13
Termux provides only clang-14, and doens't keep track of previous versions
Use the files in this folder to install packages required to have clang-v13, using:
	>> dpkg -i <deb_file.deb>

To uninstall previous versions in termux use:
	>> pkg uninstall <pkg_name>
